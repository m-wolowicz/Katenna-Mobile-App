## Project Description:

Have you ever had to let go of an employee? Have you ever had to fire an employee? Have you ever had an employee quit on you? Do you know what "institutional knowledge" is?

HR experts have shown that employees who leave an organization take a substantial amount of invaluable operational knowledge with them. It's difficult to replace or duplicate by organizations, especially when internal systems to retain, replace or document it are nonexistent. That is what experst call "Institutional Knowledge"

The Katenna Application, is the solution to this problem

Katenna is a combination of an Administrator Desktop Application ([Available Here](https://github.com/m-wolowicz/Katenna)) and an End-User Mobile Application. The live app shows an example of the Tides South Beach Hotel using our application (showcased in this GitHub Repo). The Administrator goes to our katenna.com landing page, where they can log in. After successfully logging in, an administrator can manage all tasks and duties within the hotel, as they relate to each employee and each department. Features include storing information in the database, adding, deleting, editing and assigning individual tasks. Additionally, the mobile application can be accesses by the hotel's employees, with their own authentication login, in the mobile application. Once inside the application, they can quickly retrieve information about their specific tasks an duties, using the integrated chat bot. They can also send suggestions upwards to their supervisors and managers about improvements or changes to specific tasks, which can be approved and added to the database.
